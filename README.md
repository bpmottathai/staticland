## About

The `staticland` command-line tool is used to publish static sites to [static.land](https://static.land) and [self-hosted instances of staticland-api](https://github.com/staticland/staticland-api).

### Features
- One command to deploy a site.
- Automatic SSL using Let's Encrypt.
- Use any static site generator.
- Open source & MIT-licensed. Host it yourself to use it how you want.

### Limitations
- DNS records must be set up and propogated before deploying a site for the first time.
- Setting aliases or redirects is not currently supported.

### Deploying sites
Set up a [staticland API server](https://github.com/staticland/staticland-api) or use https://static.land.

Create an account on static.land:

```sh
staticland register
```

Use `--server yourstaticlandserver.com` to use a custom server.

Ensure that your domain's DNS settings are pointing at `52.39.104.182` (or the IP address of your custom server) before deploying:

```sh
host static.land
static.land has address 52.39.104.182
```

Setting the DNS before deploying is required for Let's Encrypt to successfully provision a certificate.

Deploy a site with auto-SSL:

```sh
staticland path/to/site/ example.com
```

The above command is a shorthand version of the `deploy` command, and works the same as this example:

```sh
staticland deploy path/to/site/ example.com
```

## Install

```
npm i -g staticland
```

`staticland` requires Node.js and npm. [Install Node.js if you haven't already](https://nodejs.org).
